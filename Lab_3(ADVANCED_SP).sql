--Part – A 
--1. Create Stored Procedure for Employee table As User enters either First Name or Last Name and based 
--on this you must give EmployeeID, DOB, Gender & Hiredate.

	WHERE (FirstName=@FIRSTNAME)
	OR (LastName=@LASTNAME)
END

--2. Create a Procedure that will accept Department Name and based on that gives employees list who 
--belongs to that department.

--5. Create a Procedure that will accepts a date and gives all the employees who all are hired on that date
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE PR_EMPLOYEE_BY_HIREDATE
    @HireDate DATETIME
AS
BEGIN
